# classes

* This is the set of classes (as of 12/2022) converted into a Composer Package
* To use it, First 
```
composer require jcoonrod/classes
```
* This will load the classes inside vendor, using the namespace thpglobal/classes
* With luck, this will create an entire app with just two includes - thpsecurity and menu
* Second - copy the files from the static folder here into your app static folder
